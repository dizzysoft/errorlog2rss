# Track a Server's Error Log with RSS

If you put this RSS script into a server's directory, it will take the error log and convert it into an RSS feed for you. This is a great way to keep track of any errors that happen with a script running in that directory. It's even better when you use IFTTT to send the RSS feed to you as a notification.

This originally appeard in my blog (http://www.dizzysoft.com/track-apache-error-logs-with-php/) but I'm putting it in GitHub as part of learning both Git and GitHub.
